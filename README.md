# **IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE DOWNLOADING:**
Since the .wotmod size for this mod is greater than 100 mb (which is not supported on Github without using LFS), the .wotmod required for install has been included in a compressed .zip file. Therefore, please download [this .zip file](ClassicsWoTWorkshop-60TP-Lewandowskiego-Trwaly-Remodel-v1.0.0-[1.9.1.2].zip), rather than downloading the master zip from this repo (as the master zip compression may cause issues).

To install, drag the .wotmod file included in the aforementioned .zip file to <Your WoT Directory\mods\<Game Version>. 

> (Example: `C:\Games\World_of_Tanks\mods\1.9.1.2`)
